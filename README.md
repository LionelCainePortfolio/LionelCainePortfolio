📚 I started my adventure with mobile applications long before I finished these courses. I mainly learned beforehand from tutorials on yt, online forums, stackoverflow and by trial and error. Quite recently I came across udemy and decided that I would buy some courses to brush up on my current knowledge. Since then, I have regularly attended IT courses, earning certifications that I am happy to share during interviews.
